	<h3> What Projects have I worked on? </h3>
	<p class="leftS"> I have undertaken diverse projects such as data cleaning, data analytics, web programming, cloud IaaS, cloud SaaS, network infrastructure set up on cisco routers and switches. </p>
	<ul class="leftS">
		<li>
			<a href="kids/index.html"> Math problems for kids.</a> The main idea of this project is to automate math problem creation for my kids. All problems are automatically graded as well so they know how many problems did they solve correctly. It covers the range of problems such as reading analogue clock, find missing numbers in a sequence of numbers, counting and adding coin denominations, addition, subtraction and multiplication. Moreover, animated help is provisioned for addition, subtraction and multiplication in case they are stuck. I used Javascript, HTML to create it.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="shoppingCart/index.html"> Shopping cart </a> In this university project, using HTML, Javascript and PHP, I created an online shopping cart system in which users can select items to buy and update their shopping cart.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/shwetambry/ReservationSoftware"> Java: Room reservation software </a> This is another uni project created using Java. In this project, I created a hotel reservation system for booking rooms, checking availabilities for specific dates and specific room types.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/shwetambry/Project-Get-Clean-Data/blob/master/run_analysis.R"> R: Data cleaning </a> This project was done in an introductory R course on Coursera taught by Roger Peng. In this project, I wrote an 'R code' for cleaning a provided dataset. 
		</li>
	</ul>

<div class="container-fluid bg-1 text-center" id = "my_interests">
	<h3> What are my interests? </h3>
	<p class="leftS">I like to program almost anything especially games. Here, I will keep posting the games I program.</p>
	<ul class="leftS">
		<li><a href="TicTacToe/index.html"> Tic Tac Toe </a> Do you like playing Tic Tac Toe? Try playing by clicking the hyperlink. I got an inspiration to create this game on web while tutoring for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/girlsprogrammingnetwork/"> Girls Programming Network</a> in Sydney. As a tutor, my task was to help high school girls learn programming TicTacToe in Python. Inspired by that, I wrote it in Javascript to broaden its scope and enhance its usability. It helped me to enhance my JQuery skills too. 
		</li>
		<li> <a href="blackjack/index.html"> BlackJack</a> Do you like playing BlackJack? Try playing here. Currently it is a one player and a dealer game but I plan to make it a multi-player game very soon. In this game, I used the card images available from <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/"> </a>. I wrote it using HTML, CSS and Javascript (especially JQuery). I hope you enjoy it.
