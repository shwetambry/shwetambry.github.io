			<h2> Paralegal Support - Drafting</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="section_matter no-center">
			<p>
				The foundation of any industry, corporation, business or sector is based on its ability to
				fine-tune its operation to an extent that it has the time to focus on aspects that really
				contribute to growth and development.</p>
			<p>
				These are known as core activities and while their importance cannot be questioned
				there is another side to the picture. There is always a wide range of tasks that support the
				main ones without which no industry can function well. The same is relevant for the
				legal scenario too.</p>
			<p>
				Client servicing, trials, depositions and exact interpretation of the law form the basis of
				legal practice but all these have to be ably backed up by drafting of contracts,
				agreements, documents and letters and legal research on cases including non-legal
				research. These paralegal tasks are crucial to the success of any case.</p>
			<p>
				It has been proved beyond any reasonable doubt that if you opt for paralegal support
				services it can do wonders for your legal firm. But before coming to a detailed analysis
				of how and why this can be achieved, it will be relevant to see the areas of law for which
				you can take help of these specialized services.</p>
			<p>
				These include broadly all branches of corporate and business law, criminal and civil law,
				banking, finance, bankruptcy and labor, and employment law and others pertaining to
				patents and trademarks, product liability, personal injury, and immigration laws.</p>
			<p>
				This list is only indicative and not exhaustive in nature. Any backup required under
				these laws can be safely entrusted to paralegal outsourcing agencies that have over the
				years built up a strong infrastructure of resources and are well versed in the finer
				nuances of every aspect of the law.
			</p>
			<p style="color: red;">
				There are two scenarios that will be considered here and these are the biggest
				beneficiaries of a top of the line paralegal support services:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li> <strong> Law firms and corporations</strong>
					<p>
						While the business goals are different for these two entities, there is common ground
						when it comes to  outsourcing paralegal services . In both cases, you can take assistance
						on-demand from these agencies without resorting to adding to the staff strength
						whenever there is a short-term rise in legal requirements. This will keep overheads under
						control.</p>
					<p>
						There is also an increase in productivity as you have the time to focus on core activities
						related to your business or law firm while outsourcing the regular and tedious tasks to
						paralegals. Examples of the work that can be delegated include assistance in due
						diligence, reviewing contracts and agreements and normal corporate assistance in legal
						matters which the regular legal department need not be tied down to.</p>
					<p>
						For law firms specifically, you can be sure that paralegal support services have the
						necessary professional expertise to carry out all backup services. You do not need to get
						tied down to the tedious task of legal research, drafting, and preparation of contracts and
						agreements and reviewing existing letters and documents for loopholes in the law.</p>
					<p>
						This saves you the costs of hiring a legal team to look after these aspects only, more so
						since backup work is mostly on a project to project basis and not all forms run
						simultaneously. Permanent staff will, therefore, be underutilized.
					</p>

				</li>

				<li><strong>Small firms and individual practitioners</strong>
					<p>
						This is the sector that is most benefitted by paralegal support services. If you have a
						small law firm these services are like an extension of your business. You need not be
						limited by scalability issues knowing there is a whole team of expert paralegals to
						support you.</p>
					<p>
						There is a significant saving in infrastructure investment as the majority of the work can
						be outsourced while you focus on incremental business and new clients as well as trials
						and depositions. The research and preparation of briefs will be ready for you at prices
						that will not break your bank.</p>
					<p>
						The same is true for individual and solo practitioners of law who can depend on expert
						services, both on legal and administrative fronts. They can expand business knowing
						that there is always a team of senior paralegals to back them up in every respect. This is

						a big help especially when they take on more business without having to incur
						prohibitive overheads.</p>
					<p>
						Do not worry when you go for more business or in the case of law firms or corporate
						entities when there is a sudden jump in the quantum of business. Paralegal support
						services will take care of the finer details leaving you to concentrate on the broader
						picture.

							is it done?</a>
					</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-collapse collapse " id="collapse7">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>Licensing a patent simply means that the patent owner grants permission to another
							individual/organization to make, use, sell etc. his/her patented invention. This takes place
							according to agreed terms and conditions (for example, defining the amount and type of
							payment to be made by the licensee to the licensor), for a defined purpose, in a defined
							territory, and for an agreed period of time. </p>
						<p>
							A patent owner may grant a license to a third party for many reasons. The patent owner may
							not have the necessary manufacturing facilities, for example, and therefore opts to allow
							others to make and sell his/her patented invention in return for “royalty” payments.
							Alternatively, a patent owner may have manufacturing facilities, but they may not be large
							enough to cover market demand. In this case, he/she may be interested in licensing the
							patent to another manufacturer in order to benefit from another income stream. Another
							possible situation is one in which the patent owner wishes to concentrate on one geographic
							market; therefore the patent owner may choose to grant a license to another
							individual/organization, with interests in other geographical markets. Entering into a
							licensing agreement can help to build a mutually-beneficial business relationship.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike selling or transferring a patent to another party, the licensor continue to have
							property rights over the patented invention.

					<h4 class="panel-title">
						<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse8">8. Why are patents useful (to society, business,
							individuals etc.)? </a>
					</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-collapse collapse " id="collapse8">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>
							Patented inventions have, in fact, pervaded every aspect of human life, from electric
							lighting (patents held by Edison and Swan) and plastic (patents held by Baekeland), to
							ballpoint pens (patents held by Biro), and microprocessors (patents held by Intel, for
							example).
						</p>
						<p>
							Patents provide incentives to and protection for individuals by offering them recognition
							for their creativity and the possibility of material reward for their inventions. At the
							same time, the obligatory publication of patents and patent applications facilitates the
							mutually-beneficial spread of new knowledge and accelerates innovation activities by, for
							example, avoiding the necessity to “re-invent the wheel”.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once knowledge is publicly available, by its nature, it can be used simultaneously by an
							unlimited number of persons. While this is, without doubt, perfectly acceptable for public
							information, it causes a dilemma for the commercialization of technical knowledge. In the
							absence of protection of such knowledge, “free-riders” could easily use technical knowledge
							embedded in inventions without any recognition of the creativity of the inventor or
							contribution to the investments made by the inventor. As a consequence, inventors would
							naturally be discouraged to bring new inventions to the market, and tend to keep their
							commercially valuable inventions secret. A patent system intends to correct such
							under-provision of innovative activities by providing innovators with limited exclusive
							rights, thereby giving the innovators the possibility to receive appropriate returns on
							their innovative activities.
						</p>
						<p>
							In a wider sense, the public disclosure of the technical knowledge in the patent, and the
							exclusive right granted by the patent, provide incentives for competitors to search for
							alternative solutions and to “invent around” the first invention. These incentives and the
							dissemination of knowledge about new inventions encourage further innovation, which assures
							that the quality of human life and the well-being of society is continuously enhanced.

							India?</a>
					</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-collapse collapse " id="collapse9">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>
							This is common question being asked many times by inventors in hope of judging whether it is
							really worth to go for filing patent for the invention.
						</p>
						<p>
							Before answering this question, I would ask <strong>what are the advantages of having a real
								estate property on your name?</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>You can rent it</li>
								<li> You can sell it </li>
								<li>You can stop others from using it without your permission </li>
								<li> You can use it for your purpose (business or residence)</li>
							</ul>

							on similar terms, patent is an intellectual property and has all the advantages stated
							above, but you need to claim it to be on your name, hence the filing of patent application
							for your invention. There is a difference though, Unlike real estate the patent has the term
							of 20 years of ownership. after that they are open to be used by anyone. Hence the Patents
							system are built to encourage the innovation and growth of the economy be providing patent
							winner and exclusive right on the invention (intellectual property) for limited time.
						</p>
						<p> <strong>
								Advantages of owning patent would be: </strong>
							<ul>
								<li>You own the invention for given time (20 years)</li>
								<li>You can use it to build a business</li>
								<li>Rent it (in this case license it) to existing businesses</li>
								<li>Exclude all others for using, selling, offering for sale and importing your
									invention in your country </li>
								<li>You can completely sell the patent to other company</li>
							</ul>

							hence this gives a <strong> advantage to patent owner </strong>which can be leveraged for:
							<ol>
								<li>Building business around the invention</li>
								<li>Having patent helps in raising capital for business</li>
								<li>Patent rights can be licensed to other companies to receive royalty payments</li>
								<li>You can sell the patent</li>
								<li>Being owner of the patent you have rights to block others from
									<ul>
										<li>making,</li>
										<li>using,</li>
										<li>selling or offering for sale, and</li>
										<li>importing the patented invention</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Thus businesses and inventors can have a complete monopoly and competitive
									advantage</li>

						<p>
							As a research student, you need to be very careful that you are not putting all of your
							efforts in something which is already invented and patented. If that becomes the case, you

						</p>
						<p>
							Getting patent is NOT always about inventing something earth breaking solution !!! even
							small solution solving problems in existing (known) technology can win patent.
						</p>
						<p>
							Many patents are awarded for inventions that are either
							<ul>
								<li>technically advance or</li>
								<li> significant to the existing patents (or prior art)</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							So, a prior art documents or patents that are already existing can be 99% similar to your
							invention Yet, if your invention has either technical advance or economic significance or
							both... and you can prove it that your invention is better than existing ones by means of
							results comparisons testing and if possible working model, then there is a strong
							possibility that you may get patent for your invention.
						</p>
						<p>
							The best way to go about making this decision is get help from patent agent and patent
							attorneys.
						</p>
						<p>
							The novelty search (also called as patentability search) is performed for the same reason,
							This patentability search, done right, can yield pretty fantastic results for your
							invention;
							<ul>
								<li>It can tell you what part of your invention is already covered and what could be
									novelty
									feature…</li>
								<li>it can tell you where you can focus you research work to get maximum level of
									protection
									with you patent</li>

							<strong>Step 3: check whether the invention is patentable subject matter</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							All inventions may not be patentable, as per Indian patent act there are certain inventions
							that are not patentable explained in detail in(inventions not patentable)
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Step 4a: Patentability search </strong></p>
						<p>
							The next step would be finding out whether your invention meets all patentability criteria
							as per Indian patent act? That is,
							<ul>
								<li>Novelty</li>
								<li>Non-obviousness</li>
								<li>Industrial application</li>
								<li>Enabling</li>
							</ul>
							The detailed explanation for patentability criteria is given here (what are patentability
							criteria’s). The patentability opinion is provided by the patent professionals up on
							conducting
							extensive search and forming patentability report.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Step 4b: Decide whether to go ahead with patent</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							The patentability report and opinion helps you decide whether to go ahead with the patent or
							not, chances are what you thought as novel might already been patented or know to public in
							some
							form of information. Hence this reports saves lots of time, efforts and cost of the inventor
							by
							helping him decide whether to go ahead with the patent filing process or not.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Step 5: Draft (write) patent application</strong></p>
						<p>
							In case you are at very early stage in the research and development for your invention, then
							you
							can go for <strong>provisional application</strong>. It gives following benefits:
							<ul>
								<li>Secures filing date</li>
								<li>12 months of time to file complete specification</li>
								<li>Low cost</li>
							</ul>
							After filing provisional application, you secure the filing date which is very crucial in
							patent world. You get 12 months of time to come up with the complete specification, up on
							expiry of 12 months your patent application will be abandoned.
						</p>
						<p>
							When you complete the required documents and your research work is at level where you can
							have
							prototype and experimental results to prove your inventive step you can file complete
							specification with patent application.
						</p>
						<p>
							Filing the provisional specification is the optional step, if you are at the stage where you
							have complete information about your invention then you can directly go for complete
							specification.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Step 6: Publication of the application</strong></p>
						<p>
							Up on filing the complete specification along with application for patent, the application
							is
							published after 18 months of first filing.</p>
						<p>
							An early publication request can be made along with prescribed fees if you do not wish to
							wait
							till the expiry of 18 months from the date of filing for publishing your patent application.
							Generally the patent application is published within a month form request form early
							publication.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Step 7: Request for examination</strong></p>
						<p>
							The patent application is examined only after receiving request for examination that is RFE.
							Up on receiving this request the controller gives your patent application to a patent
							examiner who examines the patent application with different patentability criteria like:
							<ul>
								<li>Patentable subject matter</li>
								<li>Novelty</li>
								<li>Non-obviousness</li>
								<li>Inventive step</li>
								<li>Industrial application</li>
								<li>Enabling</li>
							</ul>
							The examiner creates a first examination report of the patent application upon reviewing it
							for
							above terms. This is called patent prosecution. Everything happening to patent application
							before grant of patent is generally called as patent prosecution.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first examination report submitted to controller by examiner generally contains prior
							arts (existing documents before the date of filing) which are similar to the claimed
							invention,
							and same is reported to patent applicant.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Step 8: respond to objections</strong></p>
						<p>
							Majority of patent applicants will receive some type of objections based on examination
							report.
							The best thing to do it analyse the examination report with patent professional (patent
							agent)
							and creating a response to the objections raised in the examination report.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a chance for an inventor to communicate his novelty over prior arts found in the
							examination report. The inventor and patent agent create and send a response to the
							examination
							that tries to prove to controller that his invention is indeed patentable and satisfies all
							patentability criteria.
						</p>
						<p><strong>
								Step 9: clearing all objections</strong></p>
						<p>
							This communication between controller and patent applicant is to ensure that all objections
							raised in the patent application are resolved. (if not the patent will not be granted ) and
							the
							inventor has his fair chance to prove his point and establish novelty and inventive step
							over
							existing prior arts.</p>
						<p>
							Up on finding the patent application in order of grant, it is grant to the patent applicant
							as
							early as possible.
						</p>
						<p><strong>
								Step 10: Grant of patent</strong></p>
						<p>
							The application would be placed in order for grant once it is found to be meeting all
							patentability requirements. The grant of patent is notified in the patent journal which is
							published time to time.</p>

							What is a patent? What are the benefits of patent registration? Several such questions

							prevent
							others from copying, trading, modifying, or importing the inventors’ ideas without their

				<div class="panel-collapse collapse " id="collapse14">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>
							Patent law develops the inventor’s confidence to generate more ideas by making him the only
							owner of his invention. Comparatively different from other kinds of Intellectual Property
							(IP), patent rights can be bought, licensed, or sold. Since these rights are
							country-specific, the patent law of one nation gives the rights valid within that country
							only. For instance – the patent granted in India gives rights that prevent unauthorized
							users from infringing, i.e., importing or using others’ ideas within Indian Territory.
							Besides inventors, the patent system benefits the nation by growing its economy, as it
							enables the public to get the desired products and services at affordable prices.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>There are a lot of benefits that the owner can enjoy after obtaining a patent, some
								of which
								are as follows:</strong>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Exclusive access to every right from the time of early filing</strong>
									<p>
										Patent registration begins bestowing the inventors with the benefits right from
										the
										first
										step, i.e., the time of filing for the patent. The applicant gets the security
										and
										surety
										that no other person or company could claim the ideas similar to his invention,
										as soon
										as
										he files the Provisional Patent Application. If someone else applies for the
										same
										patent,
										his request will get rejected for the filing period, which is 12 months in
										India.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Freedom to make changes </strong>
									<p>
										The patent law entitles the owner to use his ideas in any way for the permitted
										period.
										It
										means that the owner owns full freedom to utilize, sell, or even modify the
										original
										invention and to prevent others from making profits from the same ideas without
										his
										consent.
										With the granted patent, the inventor gets the ability to sue the user whom he
										finds
										infringing his patent rights. Note that patent infringement is a criminal
										offense.</p>
								</li>
								<li><strong>ROI (Return on Investment)</strong>
									<p>
										Sometimes, the owner finds that his invention is not bringing good outcomes for
										him and
										therefore, wants to hand it over to any other deserving or successful person.
										Once
										obtained,
										the patent rights allow him to earn a good amount of ROI, i.e., returns on his
										investments
										by commercializing the invention.</p>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Opportunities to get a good market reputation </strong>
									<p>
										Patent rights enable the inventor to get a noticeable market status and improve
										his
										portfolio by uncovering the invention publicly. It then helps him in building up
										a good
										relationship with consumers and competitors that ultimately add to his revenue.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Public disclosure</strong>
									<p>
										Patent rights allow public disclosure that helps the inventor in building up his
										portfolio
										along with increasing the funds, market value, and business partners. Sharing
										information
										that pertains to the invention publicly will demonstrate the inventors’
										specialization
										and
										good command over the technical subject-matter. All these facts benefit the
										owner by
										attracting leading and high-end investors, shareholders, business partners, and
										consumers.</p>

							A simple answer however is, anything that qualifies to be an invention can have a patent
							granted to it.
							In the above answer, the word “invention” is the key word that requires definition.</p>
						<p>
							In US, any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any
							new and useful improvement thereof may have a patent granted to it, provided it satisfies
							all other requirements of patentability.
						</p>
						<p>
							In India, an invention means a new product or a new process that involves technological
							advancement and/or has economic significance, which makes that new product or process
							non-obvious to a person who is skilled in the technology to which the product or process
							belongs. Additionally, the new product or process should be capable of being made or used in
							an industry for it to qualify as an invention.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most of the patent offices provide a simple definition of the word invention. However, they
							also provide a list of exclusions, which are not considered as inventions. This list is the

							It has been a common misconception that, a patent application is queued for examination
							after it is filed at the Indian Patent Office (IPO). In India, filing a patent application
							does not essentially mean that an Applicant for the patent is requesting the IPO to examine
							his patent application. In fact, the Applicant can refrain from filing a request for
							examining his application up to 48 months from the filing date of the Indian patent
							application.
						</p>
						<p>
							It shall be noted that, if the Indian patent application is claiming priority from a
							corresponding patent application filed in a convention country or a PCT application, then
							the 48 month duration is calculated from the priority date of the Indian patent application.
						</p>
						<p>
							In light of the above discussion, it is certain that, unless a request for examination is
							filed, the patent application will not be queued for examination. Having said that, by no
							means are we saying that just because an examination request has been filed, the patent
							application will be queued for examination.
						</p>
						<p>
							A second criterion has to be satisfied as well for the application to be queued for
							examination, and the second criterion is publication of the patent application. The patent
							application is published after 18 months from the date of filing the Indian patent
							application, unless an early publication request is filed. In case an early publication
							request is filed, then the patent application is normally published within 1 month from the
							date of filing such a request.
						</p>
						<p>
							We can summarize the above content by mentioning that, a patent application will be queued
							for examination after both the below listed criteria are satisfied:
							<ul>
								<li> The patent application has been published</li>
								<li>A request for examination of the patent application has been made</li>
							</ul>
							In case the Indian patent application is a national phase application, then the Indian
							patent application will be queued for examination after all the three below listed criteria
							are satisfied:
							<ul>
								<li>The patent application has been published</li>
								<li>A request for examination of the patent application has been made</li>
								<li>31 months has passed from the priority date of the Indian patent application, unless
									“express” request for examination is filed.</li>
							</ul>
							The Indian patent office has introduced an expedited examination of patent applications,
							which is applicable if certain criteria are met.
						</p>
						<p>
							The above mentioned are the criteria for the patent application to be queued for
							examination. Once queued, it can take a considerable amount of time, at least 2 years, to
							receive an examination report from the IPO.</p>
						<p>
							In order to expedite the patenting process in India, it is advisable to satisfy the above
							listed criteria as soon as possible.

					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>
							<strong>Patent infringement </strong>happens when a third party uses, sells, manufactures or
							imports patented
							products or technology without the permission from the patent owner. For infringement to
							occur, the prohibited activity also has to happen:
							<ul>
								<li>while the patent is valid</li>
								<li>within the country where the patent is in force</li>
							</ul>
							If you have a valid patent and suspect that someone stole or copied your invention, you can
							bring an<strong> enforcement action </strong>in court to prevent future infringement and/or
							seek damages.
						</p>
						<strong>
							Resolving patent disputes out of court </strong>
						<p> Many cases of infringement occur unintentionally. If you suspect infringement, it may be
							worth taking a considered approach to resolve the issues amicably or settle out of court.
							You can:
							<ul>
								<li>send a cease-and-desist letter to the infringing party outlining your legal position
								</li>
								<li>negotiate a licensing agreement</li>
							</ul>
							An IP adviser or a patent attorney can help you to analyze the situation and suggest the
							best course of action for <strong>resolving patent disputes.</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are unable to settle the issue informally, there are two alternatives available:
							<ul>
								<li><strong> mediation -</strong> the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) offers
									<strong>IP
										mediation services </strong></li>
								<li><strong>patent opinion service - </strong>the IPO can issue an impartial opinion on
									validity or
									infringement of patents</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							Although the opinion is not binding, it can help to resolve issues without going to court.

						</p>
						<strong>Patent infringement action</strong>
						<p>
							If you are unable to reach an agreement out of court, you can try to resolve disputes
							through civil law litigation. This should usually be a last resort. Litigation costs can be
							prohibitively high and you will have the burden of proving infringement.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are no specialized patent courts in INDIA. To initiate legal proceedings, you can file
							a claim either through the IPO or through the High Court in India (if your claim is complex
							or valuable). You can file some type of proceedings only through one or the other.
						</p>
						<strong>
							Remedies for patent infringement</strong>
						<p>
							Successful patent enforcement action usually results in one of two legal remedies:
							<ul>
								<li>an injunction to stop infringing activities</li>
								<li>monetary damages award which can be substantial</li>
							</ul>
							The court will typically expect you to have tried alternative means of dispute resolution
							before pursuing litigation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Bringing an action for patent infringement is complicated. If you need to enforce your
							patent rights, you should seek professional or legal assistance.
						</p>

						The top three advantages of patents are:
						<ol>
							<li>You get 20 years of exclusivity (protection) for your invention, meaning no one else in
								the INDIA (or in which country you have patent right) can make, use, distributed, sell,
								or
								import your invention without your permission.</li>
							<li>You have the ability to transfer, license, or sell your patent, just like you would a
								real estate property.</li>
							<li>You don’t have to keep it a secret like you would with a Trade Secret!</li>

					</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse20">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>Trade secrets are essentially of two kinds. On the one hand, trade secrets may concern
							inventions or manufacturing processes that do not meet the patentability criteria and
							therefore can only be protected as trade secrets. This would be the case of customer’s lists
							or manufacturing processes that are not sufficiently inventive to be granted a patent
							(though they may qualify for protection as a utility model). On the other hand, trade
							secrets may concern inventions that would fulfill the patentability criteria and could
							therefore be protected by patents. In the latter case, the SME will face a choice: to patent
							the invention or to keep it as a trade secret.
						</p>
						Some advantages of trade secrets include:
						<ul>
							<li>Trade secret protection has the advantage of not being limited in time (patents last in
								general for up to 20 years). It may therefore continue indefinitely as long as the
								secret is
								not revealed to the public.</li>
							<li>Trade secrets involve no registration costs (though there may be high costs related to
								keeping the information confidential).</li>
							<li>Trade secrets have immediate effect.</li>
							<li>Trade secret protection does not require compliance with formalities such as disclosure
								of
								the information to a Government authority.</li>
						</ul>
						There are, however, some concrete disadvantages of protecting confidential business
						information as a trade secret, especially when the information meets the criteria for
						patentability:
						<ul>
							<li>If the secret is embodied in an innovative product, others may be able to inspect it,
								dissect it and analyze it (i.e. "reverse engineer" it) and discover the secret and be
								thereafter entitled to use it. Trade secret protection of an invention in fact does not
								provide the exclusive right to exclude third parties from making commercial use of it.
								Only
								patents and utility models can provide this type of protection.</li>
							<li>Once the secret is made public, anyone may have access to it and use it at will.</li>
							<li>A trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent. The level of protection
								granted
								to trade secrets varies significantly from country to country, but is generally
								considered
								weak, particularly when compared with the protection granted by a patent.</li>
							<li>A trade secret may be patented by someone else who developed the relevant information by
								legitimate means.</li>

				<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse21">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>
							Contrary to patents, trade secrets are protected without registration, that is, trade
							secrets are protected without any procedural formalities. Consequently, a trade secret can
							be protected for an unlimited period of time. For these reasons, the protection of trade
							secrets may appear to be particularly attractive for SMEs. There are, however, some
							conditions for the information to be considered a trade secret. Compliance with such
							conditions may turn out to be more difficult and costly than it would appear at first
							glance. While these conditions vary from country to country, some general standards exist
							which are referred to in Art. 39 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
							Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement):
							<ul>
								<li>The information must be secret (i.e. it is not generally known among, or readily
									accessible to, circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question).
								</li>
								<li>It must have commercial value because it is a secret.</li>
								<li>It must have been subject to reasonable steps by the rightful holder of the
									information to
									keep it secret (e.g., through confidentiality agreements).</li>
							</ul>
							<strong>Example</strong>
							An SME develops a process for the manufacturing of its products that allows it to produce
							its goods in a more cost-effective manner. Such a process provides the enterprise a
							competitive edge over its competitors. The enterprise in question may therefore value its
							know-how as a trade secret and would not want competitors to learn about it. It makes sure
							that only a limited number of people know the secret, and those who know it are made well
							aware that it is confidential. When dealing with third parties or licensing its know-how,
							the enterprise signs confidentiality agreements to ensure that all parties know that the
							information is a secret. In such circumstances, the misappropriation of the information by a
							competitor or by any third party would be considered a violation of the enterprise's trade
							secrets.
						</p>
						<strong>
							Precautionary Measures to be Taken by Your SME</strong>
						<p>
							Trade secrets are widely used by SMEs. In fact, many SMEs rely almost exclusively on trade
							secrets for the protection of their IP (although in many cases they may not even be aware
							that trade secrets are legally protected). It is important, therefore, to make sure that
							enterprises take all necessary measures to protect their trade secrets effectively. This
							includes:
							<ul>
								<li>Firstly, considering whether the secret is patentable and, if so, whether it would
									not
									be
									better protected by a patent.</li>
								<li>Secondly, making sure that a limited number of people know the secret and that all
